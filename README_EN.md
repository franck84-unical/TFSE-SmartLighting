Repository associated with the paper:

**Alessandro Casavola, Giuseppe Franzè, Gianfranco Gagliardi, Francesco Tedesco**, *"Multi-Agent Sensor Fusion for Smart Urban Lighting: A Trust-Based Estimation Approach"*, IFAC JC3 2025, Padua (Italy), September 2025.

> This repository contains code and materials supporting a **multi‑agent sensor fusion** strategy with a **trust‑based estimation** mechanism for smart urban lighting.

## Contents
The current layout comes from the original source archive (`J3C.zip`). Main folders have been preserved as provided.

Key top‑level files:
- `README.md` (Italian) and `README_EN.md` (this file)
- `.gitattributes` (Git LFS rules for large/binary MATLAB/Simulink assets)
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `CITATION.cff`
- Project scripts and models (MATLAB/Simulink)

## Requirements
- MATLAB/Simulink (toolboxes as required by the provided models/scripts).
- If you plan to push or pull this repository, **Git LFS** is recommended to handle `.mat`, `.slx`, `.slxc`, `.fig`, `.eps` files.

## How to run (indicative)
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Follow instructions inside the experiment folders (e.g., `.m` scripts or Simulink models).
3. For figure reproduction, check **Scripts**/**Notebooks** (if present).
